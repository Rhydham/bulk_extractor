OK. I want to say that IDN with Cyrillic characters are very exotic in
Runet (Russian segment of Internet). None of sites I visit every day
use IDN.

Here are some sample IDN URLs:

http://россия.рф/main/page3.html
http://президент.рф/
http://хакер.su/
http://анекдоты.com/
http://кц.рф/ru/
http://казино.рф/

I don't know any examples of "international" e-mail addresses in Cyrillic.

Thanks for the info. Looks like index.dat is storing URLs as strings so I think that I'm getting them, just not the timestamp information. If you want to code it up, you can. My primary goal at the moment is to finish the journal article and any outstanding bugs.

I looked at the alphabets that you sent me. I guess I wasn't specific. Sorry! What would be most useful would be russian email addresses and russian URLs. I'm also looking for email addresses in Chinese, arabic, and other languages.  Then I can run BE on them and see what it catches and what it doesn't.

Like this one:  http://مثال.آزمایشی/صفحه%E2%80%8Cی_اصلی

1) Attached Russian alphabet written in various encoding.

2) index.dat format is described here:

:)

3) I don't think that searching and extracting crypto banking keys is
useful alone. When analyzing victim machines, you will find these keys
in all cases.

Thanks for the email. If you can get me some clean examples of Cyrillic in 1251, KOI8-R, and Unicode (UTF-8? UTF-16LE? UTF-16BE?) I will add support.

It had not occurred to me to add a parser for logfile formats.  Very easy to add.

If you can get me specification for the index.dat database, I'll add that as well.

What is the format of the crypto keys that are stolen? We could add a carver for those as well.

GNU/Linux REALLY needs strings that support Cyrillic characters in
various encoding: from codepage 1251, KOI8-R to Unicode :) Based on
cases I worked on, I think it will be nice to have a tool that can:
- extract log-entries from a data stream (unallocated space, pagefile,
swap partition, etc) in various formats (since bad guys often do "rm
-fr /var/log/*" :) ): various types of HTTP/FTP server logs (strings
and egrep are very, very slow here);
- extract separate entries of index.dat files (IE).

I do not know how to automate other case types we work on (many of our
cases are remote banking fraud - where attacker steals crypto keys
from a computer and uses them to send a payment order to transfer many
$$$ to some organization in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magadan or
even uses remote administration software - RDP, RAdmin, TeamViewer -
to send a payment order from a victim's machine directly, without
stealing the keys).

Wow. That's really amazing. Thank you so much for sending this to me.

BTW, have you looked at my "bulk_extractor" program? Is it useful for you in the work you do?  Is it missing stuff to make it useful on Russian hard drives?

Russian researchers analyzed one of the largest botnets:

Unfortunately, it seems that no English translation will be released soon.
